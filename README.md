# calculator

A very simple calculator written in python with kivy as its GUI framework. Right now, it only supports the very basic operations without giving any error.

This repository is there to show some unique thinks you can do with the kivy framework in a use case as a calculator implementation, namely an alternative to the usual number pad with a multi stroke gesture input.
